  SparkFun Photon Weather Shield basic example with soil moisture and temp
  Joel Bartlett @ SparkFun Electronics
  Original Creation Date: May 18, 2015
  This sketch prints the temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure or
  altitude to the Seril port.

  The library used in this example can be found here:
  https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Photon_Weather_Shield_Particle_Library

  Hardware Connections:
	This sketch was written specifically for the Photon Weather Shield,
	which connects the HTU21D and MPL3115A2 to the I2C bus by default.
  If you have an HTU21D and/or an MPL3115A2 breakout,	use the following
  hardware setup:
      HTU21D ------------- Photon
      (-) ------------------- GND
      (+) ------------------- 3.3V (VCC)
       CL ------------------- D1/SCL
       DA ------------------- D0/SDA

    MPL3115A2 ------------- Photon
      GND ------------------- GND
      VCC ------------------- 3.3V (VCC)
      SCL ------------------ D1/SCL
      SDA ------------------ D0/SDA

  Development environment specifics:
  	IDE: Particle Dev
  	Hardware Platform: Particle Photon
                       Particle Core

  This code is beerware; if you see me (or any other SparkFun
  employee) at the local, and you've found our code helpful,
  please buy us a round!
  Distributed as-is; no warranty is given.

    tell the sensor what mode to use. You could easily write a function that
    takes a reading in one made and then switches to the other mode to grab that
    reading, resulting in data that contains both acurate altitude and barrometric
    readings. For this example, we will only be using the barometer mode. Be sure

  //Another common unit for pressure is Inches of Mercury (in.Hg). To convert
